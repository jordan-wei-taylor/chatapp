# Welcome!

Welcome! I’m ESTHER, an AI chatbot that is trained to help you boost your memory.

These instructions will help you understand why I was created and how I might be able to help you.

Humans all have memories of personal experiences that they have had in their lives. These might be places they’ve been, people they’ve met, activities they’ve been involved in, and things that have happened to them.

People remember these memories for a lot of different reasons, for example:

+ Remembering the solutions to past problems that might be similar to current problems you’re experiencing.
+ Remembering good times to feel more positive now.
+ Remembering things you have done with other people for conversation, and to feel closer to them.
+ Remembering things that have been important to who you are as a person.

Remembering events from the past is really important for well-being.

However, for some people, remembering specific events or experiences that happened on particular days can be hard. When these people try to remember particular events in their life, they can only remember them in a more general way. For example, instead of remembering particular days from high school (e.g., a day when playing sport against another school and winning a tournament), they may remember experiences more generally (e.g., I played a lot of sport during high school). For some people, this can also mean that memories are retrieved with less detail, like who was there, what happened, how they felt or what they thought at the time.

This difficulty can be one reason that keeps people stuck in depression, or feeling like they can’t move forward, as they might find it harder to remember specific past experiences to help them in the present.

Over a decade ago, Memory Specificity Training – or MeST – was created to help train people’s memory in a way that helps them overcome depression. Over the years, MeST has been shown to be effective at achieving this goal and has been found to work among lots of different communities of people.

I was created as the latest advance in MeST, allowing lots of people to gain support through MeST without the need to go to a university or clinic to receive training.

In MeST, and in the conversations you’ll have with me, each session or ‘module’ with me will involve a little bit of information about the importance of memory and then together we will practice recalling specific memories from your past.

When you share a memory with me, it does not matter when the event happened: it may have been recently or (very) long ago. Try to recall memories from different times in your life – weeks ago, months ago, and years ago.

It does not have to be an important event from your life. It can be important to you, or not at all, it does not matter. It just needs to be something you have personally experienced.

The memory must refer to a <span style="color:teal;">specific</span> event. Here, <span style="color:teal;">specific</span> means that the memory is about <span style="color:teal;">something that happened on a particular day</span> in your past, but also lasted <span style="color:teal;">no longer than a day</span>.

It is also important that you always describe a <span style="color:teal;">different</span> memory or event with each prompt.

Try to mention as many details as possible in your answer. By details, I mean, what happened, the environment you were in, what you saw at the time, what you heard, and what you felt emotionally and physically. The more details, the better.

If you find the memory distressing for any reason, it is fine to move to the next memory, and take a break.

### Let’s look at an example:

If I ask you for a memory related to the word "good", you might write:

<div class="quote"><blockquote><i>“I always enjoy a good party”</i></blockquote></div>

However, this memory is <span style="color:red;"><b>not specific</b></span>, it does not refer to a particular event that happened on a particular day.
You could also answer:

<div class="quote"><blockquote><i>“Last summer I felt great.”</i></blockquote></div>

But this memory refers to an event that lasted longer than a day. So this one is also <span style="color:red;"><b>not specific</b></span>.

A specific answer would be:

<div class="quote"><blockquote><i>"I had a good time at Jane’s party, last month. It was a good night. It was especially good talking to John and Ross about going to the beach. Then we sat on a couch, which I remember was in the middle of a big room that had a lot of furniture in it: I ate potato chips and drank a lot of soft drink. We talked for about an hour or so. I remember Ross wearing a blue t-shirt. There were about 15 people at the party and I remember they played a lot of music that I liked."</i></blockquote></div>

This answer is <span style="color:teal;">specific</span>, as it is about an event that is less than a day long - <i>an evening party</i> - and contains <span style="color:teal;">many details</span>.

### Final instructions:
After you give your answer, I will give you feedback on whether the memory is specific enough. If the answer is not specific, then I will ask you to try again. Once you give a specific memory, we will ask you some extra follow-up questions to help you remember more details.
There are 7 modules, and each has 6 memory sharing exercises. Along the way I’ll give you more information about memory.
Please keep in mind that I’m not perfect. Don’t worry if I give you feedback you disagree with, it’s okay to move on, or provide more detail in your memory.
Please also keep in mind that anything you share with me will be stored anonymously on our secure servers and will not be shared with anyone outside of the research team.

### Now, let’s get started!
