# Missing Title

By this stage, you’ve already remembered a lot of different memories from across your life. These might have been things you think about a lot, and maybe some things that you haven’t thought about for a long time. Notice how each of these memories can help you understand yourself in different ways. Now, it’s up to you to continue to practice. You can do this in a few ways – keep using this app, remember to think of concrete experiences when you notice you are thinking more generally, and practice trying to generate as many details from past experiences as you can. Keep up the great work in this very last module.

Before you go, let’s try a few exercises. Just like last time, I will share a few words with you and for each of these I want you to share with me a specific event from your past in as much detail as possible.

Remember, the memories you provide don’t have to relate directly to the word that you see. It can just be inspired by them. The memories also don’t have to be related to important events, they can be anything from your past, but try as hard as you can to remember specific events from the past and try to give as much detail as possible.
