# Depression and Negative Memories

When you’re feeling particularly depressed, you might be more likely to remember negative events, and to remember memories in a more strongly negative way. This is partly because people are more likely to remember things that are the same emotional tone as their mood. So, if you’re feeling down or sad, then you’re more likely to remember times from the past where you felt down or sad.

This training can help you to get better at remembering positive events from your life. It can also help you to get better at remembering positive details from events in your life (e.g., how you felt, good things that happened). It might even help you remember things from negative events that were actually not all that bad (e.g., a party that you felt a bit anxious at, but still had a good chat with an old friend).

So, in these next few exercises please try particularly hard to recall events from your past where you felt positive or good. Also see if you can add extra detail to your responses to really show all of the things in the memory that made you feel so good.

Remember, the memories you provide don’t have to relate directly to the word that you see. It can just be inspired by them. The memories also don’t have to be related to important events, they can be anything from your past, but try as hard as you can to remember specific events from the past and try to give as much detail as possible.
