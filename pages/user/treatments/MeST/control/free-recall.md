# Free Recall

Let’s get straight into some practice. I’ll give you a series of words and you share a memory with me. In this mode, I will share words that might be positive (e.g., happy) or negative (e.g., sad). You don’t necessarily need to recall positive events from your past, this training is more about recalling specific and detailed events from your past.
