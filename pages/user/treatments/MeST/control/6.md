# How Journaling Your Experiences Can Help With Depression

Psychological research has shown that journaling your experiences can be helpful. There are a few reasons why this might help. For example, getting a bit of ‘distance’ from experiences by recalling them that night or the next day can help reduce some of the emotional impact of them. It can also help to identify patterns in how you think, feel, and behave.

Sometimes when you notice these patterns you can try and move out of the ones that aren’t helpful, and promote the ones that are. Also, if being depressed means that you’re more likely to remember sad memories, then you can use journaling to promote remembering of positive memories too. This can help us to ‘balance’ your perspective on things. This can be a useful thing to do each day, even outside of this program.

Let’s try a few exercises. You might notice that there are a few words that have a negative emotional tone. Please try and answer them in the same way you did the other words. Remember, this training is not necessarily about working through any of those difficult times, but just about thinking about the past.
Remember the memories you provide don’t have to relate directly to the word that you see. It can just be inspired by them. The memories also don’t have to be related to important events, they can be anything from your past.
