# Welcome!

I’m Esther, an AI chatbot that is trained to help you boost your memory.

These instructions will help you understand why I was created and how I might be able to help you.

Humans all have memories of personal experiences that they have had in their lives. These might be places they’ve been, people they’ve met, activities they’ve been involved in, and things that have happened to them.

People remember these memories for a lot of different reasons, for example:

+ Remembering the solutions to past problems that might be similar to current problems you’re experiencing.
+ Remembering good times to feel more positive now.
+ Remembering things you have done with other people for conversation, and to feel closer to them.
+ Remembering things that have been important to who you are as a person.

Remembering events from the past is really important for well-being.

However, for some people, remembering events or experiences that happened can be hard. This difficulty can be one reason that keeps people stuck in depression, or feeling like they can’t move forward.

Each session or ‘module’ with me will involve a little bit of information about the importance of memory and then together we will practice recalling memories from your past.

When you share a memory with me, it does not matter when it happened: it may have been recently or (very) long ago. Try to recall memories from different times in your life – weeks ago, months ago, and years ago.

It does not have to be an important event from your life. It can be important to you, or not at all, it does not matter. It just needs to be something you have personally experienced.

It is important that you always describe a <span style="color:teal;">different</span>  memory or event with each prompt.

If you find the memory distressing for any reason, it is fine to move to the next memory, and take a break.

There are 7 modules, and each has 6 memory sharing exercises. Along the way I’ll give you more information about memory.

Please keep in mind that I’m not perfect. If I make a mistake please just proceed with the training.

Please also keep in mind that anything you share with me will be stored anonymously on our secure servers and will not be shared with anyone outside of the research team.

Now, let’s get started!
