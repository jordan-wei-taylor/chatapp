# Going from General to Specific Ways of Thinking

We’ve already covered the idea that depression is related to thinking about things in very general ways. For example, ‘nothing I do is right’, ‘nothing ever works out for me’, or ‘none of my friends seem to like me”. Not only can this type of thinking keep you feeling depressed, but it’s also usually pretty inaccurate too! We call this “overgeneralising”.

By getting better at remembering specific events from your life, you can start to build up a store of lots of different types of experiences you can draw on. Next time you catch yourself thinking in very general (and especially negative) ways, see if you can recall some times that contradicted this, maybe some of the things that you’ve shared with me. For example, can you remember times when you did something you felt good about, something that worked out well, or a good time you had with a friend. Usually, when people try, they can recall experiences like this. Think of it like a skill that can be used to overcome depression.

Let’s try a few exercises.

Remember, the memories you provide don’t have to relate directly to the word that you see. It can just be inspired by them. The memories also don’t have to be related to important events, they can be anything from your past, but try as hard as you can to remember specific events from the past and try to give as much detail as possible.
